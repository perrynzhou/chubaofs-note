Data Subsystem
======================

How To Start DataNode
---------------------

Start a DataNode process by execute the server binary of ChubaoFS you built with ``-c`` argument and specify configuration file. At least 4 data nodes are required in respect to high availability.

.. code-block:: bash

   nohup cfs-server -c datanode.json &


Configurations

   "listen", "string", "Port of TCP network to be listen", "Yes"
   "localIP", "string", "IP of network to be choose", "No,If not specified, the ip address used to communicate with the master is used."
   "prof", "string", "Port of HTTP based prof and api service", "Yes"
   "logDir", "string", "Path for log file storage", "Yes"
   "logLevel", "string", "Level operation for logging. Default is *error*", "No"
   "raftHeartbeat", "string", "Port of raft heartbeat TCP network to be listen", "Yes"

   "raftDir", "string", "Path for raft log file storage", "No"
   "consulAddr", "string", "Addresses of monitor system", "No"
   "exporterPort", "string", "Port for monitor system", "No"
   "masterAddr", "string slice", "Addresses of master server", "Yes"
   "zoneName", "string", "Specified zone. ``default`` by default.", "No"

**Example:**

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "role": "datanode",
       "listen": "17310",
       "prof": "17320",
       "logDir": "/cfs/datanode/log",
       "logLevel": "info",
       "raftHeartbeat": "17330",
       "raftReplica": "17340",
       "raftDir": "/cfs/datanode/log",
       "consulAddr": "http://consul.prometheus-cfs.local",
       "exporterPort": 9502,
       "masterAddr": [
            "10.196.59.198:17010",
            "10.196.59.199:17010",
            "10.196.59.200:17010"
       ],
        "disks": [
           "/data0:10737418240",
           "/data1:10737418240"
       ]
   }


Notice
-------------

  * Since datanode uses **SEEK_HOLE** and **SEEK_DATA** operations which is supported by XFS (since Linux 3.5) and ext4 (since Linux 3.8), users should pay attention to the Linux kernel version on which datanodes are deployed.
  * `listen`, `raftHeartbeat`, `raftReplica` can't be modified after boot startup first time.
  * Above config would be stored under directory `raftDir` in `constcfg` file. If need modified forcely, you must delete this file manually.
  * These configuration items associated with master's datanode infomation. If they have been modified, master would't be found old datanode.
